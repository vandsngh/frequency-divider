# Frequency-divider using CMOS
#Abstract
##This paper is about a frequency divider.It is a circuit that takes the
input and divide it by specified value. It is also called clock
divider. There are many circuit which use frequency dividers
to generate a frequency that is a multiple of a reference
frequency. It has a vital role in Phase locked loop frequency
synthesizers. Frequency dividers can be implemented for both
analog and digital application.

#Circuit Details
D type flip flop is used as a frequency divider .It can be seen
from the fig.1 frequency waveforms above, that by “feeding
back “the output from q bar to the input terminal d, the
output pulses at q have a frequency that are exactly one half
(f/2) that of the input clock frequncy.The circuit function is
to divide or drop the frequency of the high frequency signal
to get the lower frequency signal for a given frequency signal
by division. Analog frequency dividers are less common and
used only at very high frequencies. Digital dividers
implemented in modern IC technologies can work up to tens
of GHz. An arrangement of flip flop is a classic method for
integer-n division.
